### Welcome to specdown.

Specdown is a simple testing abstraction that sits on top of markdown, and concordion for a simple, easy to use
english written specification engine.

The basic concept is that you just => write your specification documents <= in plain text, using the Markdown style markup
tool, and include special "specification" statements when, and where you need them.

  => When the system is in brown out, service agreements should not be creatable.  What do you people think "brown
     out" means?
  => Create new testing customer.
  => Changing parameter output.
  => Including assertion messages.

In order to keep things small and localized, you should [link to other specifications](Otherspecs.html) and keep
the flow moving.
